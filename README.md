# Plants vs. Zombies Heroes Card Editor
 A rather simple Plants vs. Zombies Heroes card editor (in JSON format) based on Avalonia.
# Features
 * Fully fledged-out editor
# Known Pitfalls
 * Rather high memory consumption,
 * Occassional UI bugs,
 * Auto-save does not detect some data changes (however, they get changed next time you change something),
 * Possible data errors (highly unlikely though).
